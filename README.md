# SoftwareRenderer3D
My own implementation of a 3D software renderer for the purpose of learning 3d computer graphics.

#### Next steps
- Implement triangle rasterization.

#### Why C# and not C or C++?
The focus of this work is mainly on applying and understanding different concepts for rendering a complete 3d scene. Using C or C++ properly would make the entire project more difficult.

To [Chili](https://www.planetchili.net) for his amazing lessons on 3d fundamentals.
